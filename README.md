Here's how to use the  Flutter App:

Task Completion: To mark a task as completed, tap the checkbox next to the task's name.

Delete Completed Tasks: Clear your completed tasks by tapping the "Delete" button at the bottom.

Persistence: Your tasks are stored locally, so you won't lose them when you close the app.
